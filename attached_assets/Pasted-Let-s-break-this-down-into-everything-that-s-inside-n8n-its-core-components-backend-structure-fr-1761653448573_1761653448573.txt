Let’s break this down into everything that’s inside n8n — its core components, backend structure, frontend logic, plugin/agent system, and how you can build a similar application.

🧩 1. n8n Overview

n8n = "Node-based automation" platform.
It allows users to:

Authenticate with their own accounts

Create workflows (agents) by connecting nodes

Integrate APIs, database, webhooks, code functions, etc.

Trigger automation manually, on schedule, or via API

Host privately or use their cloud instance

⚙️ 2. n8n’s Core Components
Layer	Description	Your Equivalent When Building
🧠 Workflow Engine	Executes flows made of nodes (each node = 1 task)	Build a workflow runner system
📦 Nodes Library	Hundreds of integrations (API, DB, Email, etc.)	Build pluggable node system
👤 Auth System	Users login via OAuth, email-password, or SSO	Use JWT + OAuth2
🌐 Webhooks	Receive external triggers	Create dynamic route generation
🪄 Expression Parser	Allows {{ }} dynamic values	Build custom expression evaluator
🧰 Editor UI	Visual drag-and-drop node editor (React + Canvas)	Build React Flow-based visual builder
💾 Database	Stores users, workflows, executions	Use PostgreSQL / MongoDB
🪶 API Layer	REST/GraphQL for managing workflows	Create REST API backend
📤 Execution Logs	Track past runs, errors, inputs, outputs	Build execution history system
🔐 Credentials System	Securely store API keys	Build encrypted credentials manager

🧩 4. Node (Agent) System

Each node (agent) is like a micro-plugin:

{
  name: "HTTP Request",
  type: "httpRequest",
  inputs: ["url", "method", "body"],
  outputs: ["response"],
  execute: async (input) => {
    const res = await fetch(input.url, { method: input.method, body: input.body });
    return { response: await res.json() };
  }
}


You can build:

A Node Registry (database table or JSON config)

Each node defines:

Name, Type, Inputs, Outputs

UI Config Schema

Execution Function (JS)

Optional Auth Requirements

👥 5. User & Authentication System

Users can:

Sign up with email/password or OAuth

Create Workspaces

Create Agents/Nodes inside workspaces

Stack Example:

# Backend
Express.js + JWT + bcrypt + PostgreSQL
# Frontend
Next.js / React + Zustand or Redux
# Auth Flow
/login → backend verifies → returns token → store in localStorage

🧠 6. Agent Creation System

When a user logs in:

They can create a new agent (node)

Define input/output fields

Add script (JS code)

Add environment variables

Save it → backend stores it as a node

It appears in their workflow editor

They can drag-drop and connect with other nodes

⚡ 7. Workflow Execution Engine

This is the core engine that runs workflows.

Algorithm:

for (const node of workflow.nodes) {
  const input = gatherInputs(node);
  const output = await executeNode(node, input);
  passOutputToNext(node, output);
}


Use a graph traversal algorithm (topological order)

Store each run log in a DB

Handle async tasks (promises)

Allow retry / stop / pause

🧰 8. Example Tech Stack (n8n-like clone)
Layer	Recommended Tech
Frontend	React + React Flow + TailwindCSS
Backend	Node.js + Express.js or NestJS
Database	PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
Auth	JWT + Passport.js or NextAuth
Execution Engine	Custom Node Runner (JS Sandbox)
Hosting	Docker + Railway / Render / Vercel
Storage	S3 / Cloudinary for assets
Message Queue	Redis (for async executions)
🪄 9. Optional Add-ons

🔄 Webhook nodes – for external triggers

🕒 Cron jobs – for scheduled workflows

🔐 Encrypted credential manager

📈 Dashboard – track usage & executions

🌍 Public API – allow embedding workflows

🧩 Marketplace – share public nodes

💡 10. Example User Flow

User signs up

Dashboard opens → “Create New Agent”

User defines:

Agent name, input schema, output schema

Adds logic (JS or prebuilt function)

Saves agent

Opens workflow editor → drag their agent + connect others

Runs workflow → view results

Deploy workflow as webhook/API endpoint

🧠 11. If You Want to Build It Step-by-Step
Phase	Focus	Time (approx)
1	Auth + DB + REST API	1 week
2	Workflow Editor (React Flow)	2 weeks
3	Node Execution Engine	2 weeks
4	Webhooks + Triggers	1 week
5	Dashboard + Logs	1 week
6	Node Marketplace + Custom Agents	1 week
7	Optimization + Hosting	1 week

Generate the complete folder structure (frontend + backend) for this n8n-like app?

Or first create a high-level architecture diagram (mermaid or image) for the system?
